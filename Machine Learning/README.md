In this project, we have used machine learning to classify hotels based on given features.

In Data preprocessing, we familiarize ourselves with the data and work on transforming it into a format suitable for training the model.
We use Naïve Bayesian, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting, XGBoost, SAMME and Stacking.

Accuracyof Models:

Naïve Bayesian: 71.19% 

Decision Tree:90.42%

Random Forest:91.90%

Adaptive Boosting:80.85%

XGBoost:90.79%

SAMME:90.06%

Stacking:92.63%

You can find the complete information on data preprocessing, models, and their evaluation in the file *Machine Learning.pdf*, which is written in English.
