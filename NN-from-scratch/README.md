In this project, we will explore deep neural networks. First, we will implement neural networks and analyze their performance. Then, we will combine these networks to create a deep neural network. Finally, we will use this network for classification dataset: MNIST dataset, and we will train and evaluate the model.

You can find the complete information on data preprocessing, models, and their evaluation in the file *DNN.pdf*, which is written in English.
