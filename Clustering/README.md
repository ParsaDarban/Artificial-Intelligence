In this project, we focus on clustering various news categories. In one phase, we use pre-trained models for feature extraction, and in the second phase, we apply clustering algorithms.  

Natural language processing  and large language models come with their own challenges, such as the use of many words across different clusters with varying meanings and so on.

You can find the complete information on data preprocessing, models, and their evaluation in the file *Clustering.pdf*, which is written in English.
